In the red corridor of central eastern India a,marginalized region the communist party of India maoist is facing brutal suppression under ne ren dro modi's government.they are the most marginalized voices in India,representing landless tribal communities and dall ET tes whose resources have been plundered yet modi and his bara dia GE na da party bjp v.vilify them as enemies of the state under the guise of counter terrorism using bloody military operations to conceal their dirty political motives,the greatest terrorism in India is the modi government itself.and its massacre of CPI maoist fighters is among the bloodiest and most despicable acts in its campaign of oppression comrade nambula cache of aral general secretary of the communist party of India maoist.was martyred on May twenty first twenty twenty five in the nar yam per district,along with twenty seven other comrades under the government's butcher knife.salute to the martyrs today,we must tear off the hypocritical mask of the modi government,the fighters of the CPI maoist and.have never been a threat to India,they are the shield of the oppressed and the battle flag of the resistors. the real enemy is indias bloodthirsty capitalist systems.the corrupt regime that devours the flesh and blood of the poor modi's bullets May take the lives of martyrs,but they will never extinguish the flames of revolution.
from the red corridor to the plains of the ganges,the lies of the oppressors will be shattered by the roar of the people rise up s.let the blood of comrade raoul and the twenty seven other martyrs ignite a prairie fire to burn down this cannibalistic system revolution.never surrender at the end of the video slash article,there is a list of war criminals and specific methods for retaliating against modi's reactionary fascist government.don't miss this part.since the modi government came to power,maoists have faced unprecedented repression in twenty twenty four operation. k agger was launched in the a bouge mad forests and cara goda mountains of chatt is GAR.turning the region into a war zone with forty thousand soldiers,drones and helicopters,according to official data between twenty twenty four and twenty twenty five or.over three hundred and sixty MA lists were killed and tens of thousands of tribal people were displaced as a result. why is the modi government so determined to eliminate them a lists?the answer lies in the dirty logic of political economy since coming to power in twenty fourteen. the bjp,backed by big industrial capital,has pushed neoliberal reforms.
swiftly clearing the path for mining giants,real estate tycoons and multinational corporations,the shift of big capital from the Lndian national congress to the bjp was key to modi's rise.regions like chatt is GAR,part of the red corridor are rich in coal,iron ore and other resources,making them prime targets for global capital.the mo west's opposition to land grabs and environmental destruction directly threatens the interests of these profit hungry groups,thus under the guise of national security the modi government has carried out large scale repression through operation green hunt.and operation k agger to remove obstacles,many of the socalled maoists killed were actually innocent tribal people with security forces accused of staging fake encounters.justify massacres this is not just military repression,but capital driven ethnic cleansing the modi governments crack down not only serves capital but also aims to consolidate its efforts to weaken regional forces and strengthen centralization.accelerating the needs of capitalist modernization,the bara dia GE na da party bjp with hindu va at its core consolidates its voter base by amplifying the narrative of internal threats.
the suppression of maoists is propagandized as a victory for national security,masking the underlying economic injustices with nationalist rhetoric.bjp centralizing policies such as the goods and services tax gst and restrictions on state budgets undermine local autonomy directly,threatening the mo west model of regional resistance.must therefore be eliminated through military operations and so called development projects such as the construction of seventeen thousand,six hundred kilometers of roads and two hundred and thirty four schools.the modi government seeks to regain control over these areas. however,these projects often serve military infiltration and corporate interests rather than the welfare of tribal communities.traditional land rights are stripped away,villages are militarized and communities are left in distress,while big capital removes the layers of obstacles inherited from pre modern society.expanding through real estate and industrialization,this is also the bjp s greatest source of legitimacy,the bjp and its media vehemently accused the congress party of failing to suppress the maoists effectively.once successful,
the bjp brandishes the heads of maoist fighters to prove to the big bourgeoisie that it can eliminate all obstacles to capital's maximum examination.whether these obstacles come from agrarian capital and the petty bourgeoisie,premodern peasants and tribal communities or leftist forces advocating alternative development paths.against the backdrop of high unemployment and the disposition of tribal land rights,the bjp diverts attention by cracking down on maoists using the internal enemy as a means to rally support.this dirty political tactic harms the interests of the underprivileged while maintaining the regime's stability. furthermore,the modi government suppresses journalists.scholars and human rights activists labeling urban maoists and other dissidents as threats further stifling opposition.in twenty eighteen,the modi government's nationwide raids targeting leftist activists were widely condemned as political persecution,exposing the bjp's authoritarian nature.salute to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the communist party of India,maoist.their blood and sacrifices are forever etched in our hearts,inspiring US to fight for justice. we cannot tolerate the modi government's bloody crackdowns and brutal massacres of innocent people.
NOR can we tolerate the collusion of capital and violence to continue oppressing the underprivileged internationalists we must take action.support the struggle of the communist party of India maoist expose the crimes of the modi government and stand with the resistance.the fragility of the modi government stems precisely from their fear of the truth to conceal their crimes. they resource to information blackouts fabricating illusions and manipulating narratives.desperately hiding the atrocities they have committed in service of capitalist interests,we call upon the international community,especially those opposing modi and the fascist bjp government.take active steps in producing and disseminating propaganda materials to expose their brutalities by the internet and counterattack the modi government,the focus of these materials should include.promoting the just cause of the communist party of India maoist second exposing the crimes of war criminals involved in suppression campaigns and revealing their other scandals to undermine their credibility and that of the modi government.AI technology can be utilized to create songs,translate content and overcome language barriers,enabling these works to reach other communist organizations supporting the maoists.thereby,overcoming dissemination obstacles.below is a list of war criminals responsible for the suppression and massacre of CPI maoist fighters ne ren dro modi,
